### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

The technology ecosystem in Zambia has been a focus of mine since 2009. I'm looking to work with anyone who can help raise the quality and quantity of Zambian software and Zambian software developers.

To date:
- I am a Cofounder of [BongoHive](http://bongohive.co.zm) and [BongoHive Consult](http://bongohive.co.zm/consult)
- I lead a group of 12 software developers
- I have been a VC4A Startup Mentor and featured on [Mentorwise](https://vc4a.com/blog/channels/mentorwise/), the VC4A Podcast
- I am a founding member of the [Lusaka WordPress Meetup](https://wplusaka.wordpress.com)
- I am part of the [Exchange with Google Developers](https://events.withgoogle.com/exchange-with-google-developers/) pilot that aims to match mentors and mentees working with Google technology

I work with WordPress, Trellis, Bedrock and Sage, Ruby on Rails, Ubuntu Linux, macOS, AWS, GCP and DigitalOcean.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silumesii/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silumesii) as well.
