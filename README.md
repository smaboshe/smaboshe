### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The technology ecosystem in Zambia has been a focus of mine since 2009. I'm looking to work with anyone who can help raise the quality and quantity of Zambian software and Zambian software developers.

I am currently looking for a role as a full-time, remote Ruby on Rails developer.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silumesii/) and [X](https://x.com/silumesii) as well.
