The technology ecosystem in Zambia has been a focus of mine since 2009. I'm looking to work with anyone who can help raise the quality and quantity of Zambian software and Zambian software developers.

To date:

- Formerly [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/)
- Graduate of [Rhema Zambia](https://rhemazambia.org/) (2024)
- Co-founder of [BongoHive](https://bongohive.co.zm) and [BongoHive Consult](https://bongohive.co.zm/consult)
