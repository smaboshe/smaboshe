### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

---

The technology ecosystem in Zambia has been a focus of mine since 2009. I'm looking to work with anyone who can help raise the quality and quantity of Zambian software and Zambian software developers.

To date:

- I am a Software Developer at [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/)
- I am a student at [Rhema Zambia](https://rhemazambia.org/)
- I am a co-founder of [BongoHive](https://bongohive.co.zm) and [BongoHive Consult](https://bongohive.co.zm/consult)
- I have been a VC4A Startup Mentor and featured on [Mentorwise](https://vc4a.com/blog/channels/mentorwise/), the VC4A Podcast

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silumesii/) and [X](https://x.com/silumesii) as well.
